# Genomic Variants Metabolic Models

## About

Reconstruction of personalized metabolic models by mapping genes with significantly higher load of pathogenic variants in Alzheimer's disease onto the human genome-scale metabolic network together with gene expression data.

## Usage

This repository contains scripts for reconstructing genomic variant metabolic models using the iMAT algorithm. Certain input files must be generated using external tools, as outlined in detail by Uzuner Odongo et al. (2025). 

The file "Generation_of_iMAT_and_iMAT_Variant_Models.mlx" demonstrates how to implement the analysis. Please adjust the input files according to your specific requirements. The names of the files within the scripts describe the structure of the input files.

## Dependencies

These scripts are written in MATLAB, thus requiring a MATLAB license. Additionally, the Cobra Toolbox and Gurobi optimizer are necessary for iMAT analysis.
